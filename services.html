            <h2>Our Services</h2>
            <h3>Self-Service Equipment Rental</h3>
            <p>
                For those who prefer a more hands-on approach, our self-service
                option allows you to pick up and return the equipment yourself.
                Weâ€™ll handle the packaging, and you can collect your rental from
                our centrally located pick-up spot. This option is perfect for
                those who are confident in setting up their own equipment but
                need high-quality gear for their event.
            </p>

            <h3>Managed Service</h3>
            <p>
                For a seamless experience, choose our managed service. Our
                professional team will deliver, set up, and break down the
                equipment, ensuring everything runs smoothly. You can focus on
                your event while we handle all the technical aspects. This
                option is ideal for larger or more complex events where
                professional assistance is needed.
